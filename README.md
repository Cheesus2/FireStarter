# FireStarter

FireStarter is a Non-Root Launcher Replacement / App-Drawer for Amazon FireTV:

 * Similar to Redth's [FiredTVLauncher](https://github.com/Redth/FiredTVLauncher) but with better home-button detection and with automatic start on IkonoTV.
 * Starts itself on FireTV-Startup.
 * Starts automatically when Home-Button is pressed.
 * Starts itself when the IkonoTV app is started.
 * IkonoTV icon is automatically replaced (only in current apps).
 * Lists all user-installed apps including side-loaded apps.
 * Apps can be easily sorted by click-drag-and-drop.
 * No root required!

Install FireStarter:

 * Install IkonoTV from offical FireTV app store
 * Sideload firestarter app with adb: adb install firestarter.apk
 * IkonoTV icon is replaced at next startup (hold select + play button for a few seconds)
 * Enjoy :)

ToDo List:

 * Select on which app FireStarter starts itself (currently fixed to IkonoTV)
 * Add possibility to uninstall apps
 * Perhaps add possiblity to install and keep updated some apps via FireStarter (e.g. Kodi, Es File Explorer, ..)
